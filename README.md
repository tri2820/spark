# What's this about
Dear diary,

in this repository I shall write down every nitty-gritty of my experience with Deakin's SPARK.
It's week 1 and I only have a faint conception of how to run a business. Given how indecisive I am, I will give myself some time (weeks?) before settling for my startup idea.

Juggling between 3 units, a job and a WIL unit is excruciating.

# Week 1: No time for pizza
I'm doing great. I couldn't make it to the introduction session in person so I mailed the Spark admin and she told me I can only miss one session in the entire trimester. This means there shall be nothing but commitment going forward.

I took a plane home, barely made it for the second session tomorrow. It's a 3+9+2 flight-flight-tram journey.  

I was paired with 2 weekly buddies - I have already scheduled a donut chat with them tomorrow's morning. Someone posted a [112-page PDF book about testing if your business idea is good](https://chisel-sprout-a92.notion.site/The-Mom-Test-Summary-And-Notes-e52b18a9a66b43039952db42a2367714), I will read it when I'm on the tram - no time for pizza.

Sehar recommended everyone to set up a Wordpress or Squarespace blog but I think Github is cooler. Also I want it to appeal more to other CS-persons.

I already told someone that I'm working on a "trading platform with some interesting financial products", so maybe I will stick with that. I will post the WIP Python code/Figma that I have been working on for a month but hey, it's an entrepreneurship (tks google) unit not a programming unit so I don't think it's that important anyway.

# Week 2:
Reading MOM test (finished 1/3)

# Week 3:
I got Aaron on the team with me. Aaron has a background in IT which makes having conversation with him much more easier. He's also a motivated person. We had a discussion about the idea of building the financial product. Things are a bit slow-paced and there are areas where I will need advices from someone with expertise. However, I see a solid opportunity in this.

I had asked the customer about a related idea. I also learned how to run Instagra ads.

# Week 4:
Still working on the idea. Learned the tech.

# Week n:
It turned out this was not a diary with "every nitty-gritty of my experience" as I thought. I have not updated this log for a long time, BUT the project is still going well. The business model will continue to evolve, but at last it must be B2B. I had trouble understanding several concepts in this space: they are complicated and not public information. Good thing is, I will meet 2 customers who are specialists in this space and hopefully they can give me the answers. One is on Tuesday, the other is TBD.

The website is up. Having the website created first was a good decision (even though I spent too much time on it): in order to fit the company's mission into the homepage, I found ways to explain my ideas concisely. Aaron said we are making progress but I feel like we must talk to someone else or this will be another abandoned project soon.

Last few weeks are about just that. I had a good time making connections. And while reiterating the idea many times bored me out, it's needed.

Lessons learned: Australian government plans to have 50% less super funds by 2028, we need some capital for this model to work, and LinkedIn groups are surprisingly useful. 

# Resources
I have decided to share some resources that we have written during the creation of Leaf Finance - the synthetic token for ethical investment. This is but a fraction of the internal documents, but it should be enough for my supervisors to see the progress over time.
