# What's this about
Dear diary,

in this repository I shall write down every nitty-gritty of my experience with Deakin's SPARK.
It's week 1 and I only have a faint conception of how to run a business. Given how indecisive I am, I will give myself some time (weeks?) before settle for my startup idea.

Juggling between 3 units, a job and a WIL unit is excruciating.

# Week 1: No time for pizza
I'm doing great. I couldn't make it to the introduction session in person so I mailed the Spark admin and she told me I can only miss one session in the entire trimester. This means there shall be nothing but commitment going forward.

I took a plane home, barely made it for the second session tomorrow. It's a 3+9+2 flight-flight-tram journey.  

I was paired with 2 weekly buddies - I have already scheduled a donut chat with them tomorrow's morning. Someone posted a [112-page PDF book about testing if your business idea is good](https://chisel-sprout-a92.notion.site/The-Mom-Test-Summary-And-Notes-e52b18a9a66b43039952db42a2367714), I will read it when I'm on the tram - no time for pizza.

Sehar recommended everyone to set up a Wordpress or Squarespace blog but I think Github is cooler. Also I want it to appeal more to other CS-persons.

I already told someone that I'm working on a "trading platform with some interesting financial products", so maybe I will stick with that. I will post the WIP Python code/Figma that I have been working on for a month but hey, it's an entrepreneurship (tks google) unit not a programming unit so I don't think it's that important anyway.
